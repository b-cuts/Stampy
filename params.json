{"body":"### Stampy - a Java Implementation of the STOMP 1.2 Specification\r\nThis is a placeholder for a high-level description.  Stampy creates STOMP messages via [Java classes](https://github.com/mrstampy/Stampy/blob/master/src/asia/stampy/common/message/StampyMessage.java) and uses [Apache MINA](https://mina.apache.org/) to facilitate network connections.  STOMP messages are dealt with via an [implementation of an interface](https://github.com/mrstampy/Stampy/blob/master/src/asia/stampy/common/mina/StampyMinaMessageListener.java).  It is simple to use and requires [little](https://github.com/mrstampy/Stampy/blob/master/examples/asia/stampy/examples/loadtest/client/Initializer.java) [configuration](https://github.com/mrstampy/Stampy/blob/master/examples/asia/stampy/examples/loadtest/server/Initializer.java).  It includes both a [client](https://github.com/mrstampy/Stampy/blob/master/src/asia/stampy/client/mina/ClientMinaMessageGateway.java) & a [server](https://github.com/mrstampy/Stampy/blob/master/src/asia/stampy/server/mina/ServerMinaMessageGateway.java) implementation which can easily be tailored for individual use.\r\n\r\nA work in progress - a release will be made available shortly.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
