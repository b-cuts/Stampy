Stampy creates STOMP messages via Java classes and uses [Apache MINA](https://mina.apache.org/) to facilitate network connections.  STOMP messages are dealt with via an implementation of an interface.  It is simple to use and requires little configuration.  It includes both a client & a server implementation which can easily be tailored for individual use.\r\n\r\nA work in progress - a release will be made available shortly.","note":"Don't delete this file!
