	<h2>stampy-core-$version</h2>
	
	<p>This library provides class representations of STOMP 1.2 messages and the ability
	to convert to and from the classes.  It can be used with the additional Stampy libraries
	or it can be used with existing STOMP client or server implementations.</p>
	
	<h3>Design considerations</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Compiled for Java 5 compatibility</li>
		<li>Ease of configuration and use</li>
		<li>DI framework-friendly</li>
		<li>Minimal dependencies</li>
		<li>Reliable</li>
		<li>Extensible</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>Dependencies</h3>
	<ul>
		<li><b>&lt;dependency org="org.slf4j" name="slf4j-api"
				rev="1.7.2"/&gt;</li>
		<li>&lt;dependency org="commons-lang" name="commons-lang"
			rev="2.6"/&gt;</li>
		<li>&lt;dependency org="commons-codec" name="commons-codec"
			rev="1.7"/&gt;</b>
		</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>Messages</h3>
	
	<p>All STOMP message classes implement the 
	<a href="asia/stampy/common/message/StampyMessage.html">StampyMessage</a> interface. Message classes
	typically have at least two constructors, one blank & the other with parameters - the parameterized
	constructors are all the mandatory header values that must be set for a valid STOMP message.  Should
	any mandatory header information be missing an exception will be thrown when the message's 
	<pre><b>validate()</b></pre> method is called.</p>
	
	<p>Each StampyMessage class has an associated header class which can be obtained by calling the 
	<pre><b>getHeader()</b></pre> method.  The header classes are wrappers
	around a map which manages the key value pairs.  Known key names have their own getter and
	setter methods; any key value pair can be added to a Stampy message header.</p>
	
	<p><b>Note:</b> should a header key already exist in the map any subsequent adds for that key
	will be ignored.  This is to enforce the specification: <i>If a client or a server receives repeated 
	frame header entries, only the first header entry SHOULD be used as the value of header entry. 
	Subsequent values are only used to maintain a history of state changes of the header and MAY be ignored.
	</i> To replace an existing key the header's <pre><b>removeHeader(existingKey)</b></pre> method must be called first.</p>
	
	<h3>Parsing</h3>
	<p>A <a href="asia/stampy/common/parsing/StompMessageParser.html">message parser</a> 
	is included for converting the raw string messages to their associated
	StampyMessage objects.</p>
	
	<h3>Message Bodies</h3>
	<p>Any STOMP message that has a body can accept a string as the body as well as any Java serializable object. The
	mime type used by Stampy to represent such serialized objects is <pre><b>java/base64</b></pre>  Encoding to and
	from Base64 is handled by the message superclasses & the parser, respectively.</p>
